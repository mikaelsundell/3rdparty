        Xcode 6

      wget is optional, will fallback to curl if not found.

    - CentOS 6.3 (Final) - gcc version 4.4.6 
      
      Requirements:
        Yum installer: yum install gcc-c++ python-devel libXi-devel libXmu-devel glut-devel mesa-libGLU-devel gstream* wget

        Never install 32-bit compatibility drivers on 64-bit systems, produces configure libdir issues.
